**Matlab Example of Markov Chain with 1 Agents**

In this simple example, a Markov Chain is implemented considering 1 agent. The term "agent" in this example refers to the number of people in the zone.

This code enables the stochastic simulation of occupancy in a specific zone based on the probabilities set in the transition matrix. The transition matrix can be further extended to embed the real transition probabilities at each step (currently using proxy values).
